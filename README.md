# Keras-Assignment

In this project, I have built a regression model using the deep learning Keras library, and then I have experiment with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and you will see how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.

For your convenience, the data can be found here: https://cocl.us/concrete_data.
